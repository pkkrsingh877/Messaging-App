# Things to do

## Search Page

1. Users own profile should not be displayed in search result
2. If any user is already friend, then friends should be displayed instead of send friend request button

## Posts

1. User should be able to view posts individually with comments
2. User should be abel to comment on the posts if they are logged in


## Done

1. User should be able to create posts
2. User should be able to update posts
3. User should be able to delete posts
4. User should be able to view posts
5. User being able to update his username
6. User being able to send friend request BACKEND
7. User being able to accept friend request BACKEND
8. User being able to reject friend request BACKEND
9. Deal with cookie-parser middleware so that it does not break application
10. Separate authentication routes from user routes => put login and signup in auth routes
11. We need to make sure that user is logged in before allowing them to create, update, delete and view posts. 
12. If they try to send requests on protected routes via tools like postman then we need to make sure that they are sent a login page instead.
